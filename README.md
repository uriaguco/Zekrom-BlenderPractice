# Zekrom-BlenderPractice

This repository contains a small Blender project I made as practice.  
The subject is **Zekrom**, a Pokémon, modeled and rendered for learning purposes as part of a class project.

## Contents
- `zekrom.blend` → the Blender project file  
- `zekrom_render.png` → a rendered image preview  

## Preview
![Zekrom Render](RenderV5-Edit.png)

## Notes
- Created in **Blender 4.3.2**  
- This is a personal practice piece, not an official model  
- Feel free to open the `.blend` file and explore
- The preview has slightly altered lighting from the actual render output
